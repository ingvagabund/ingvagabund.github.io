When I wake up, I feel empty and have no idea what I am gonna do.
Some cloudy memories coming up, yet still quite distant.
This search to find what was lost and yet not found.
The tendency to catch up what I missed and have not been able to get at.
Old things, dreams, hopes and goals that used to mean
something to me. Now, just a shadow of my recent past me.
Feel like everyday I am starting over.
Putting my pieces together which do not fit anymore.
They do not fit because they exist only in the past.
There's no place for them in the present (or the future).
I need to move on, I need to appreciate every aspect of the life I have.

Maybe starting over every morning is not a bad thing.
Starting clean and not caring about anything that happened before.
Only what's right here and right now is important, nothing else.
Everything else are failed goals and unclear dreams.
One can call it experiences and ideas.
Past keeps us at bay, future makes us fear.
Just do what you feel right now.
The body knows more than it seems.
