What makes moments of life so clear that there's no questioning of what needs
to be done and just doing it?
The urge to help, the urge to understand, the urge to make a difference,
just intensity of the moment itself?
"You don't know why, you just feel it" concept is powerful. Yet, is it powerful enough?

Who or what can make one believe there's a anything to be accomplished? A task more important
than anything else in your life that you decide to concentrate
all your energy on the task? Once feeling in the importance of the task starts
to fade, who or what can remind you (or refresh) what's in stake?
Is a proof enough? A proof of what exactly? Fine logical arguments so convincing
any doubt is washed away? Is the proof powerful enough to convince oneself to continue?
Or, a memory so strong? Something deep inside reaching out, emotion filling our hearth?

What's causing all my thoughts to be aligned and focused only on a single task?
How to silence all the voices except the right one?
How to dissolve all distractions?
How to get rid of doubt? Is doubt a product of playing safe? Or lack of conviction
in what I am doing is meaningful?

It might help to feel the privilege of working on a task.
Or, maybe it's just being afraid to loose. To loose opportunity.
To loose authenticity. To loose time. To get ashamed.

If nothing works, just start something, finish it, look around, repeat?
Give yourself time to grasp the ground beneath you, to reconnected.
Maybe just take a break, deep breath, relax, free your mind
and do what feels right at the moment.
Maybe get enthusiastic or exited about something and just share it with others.
Listen to what others might have to say.
