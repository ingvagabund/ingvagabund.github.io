Do you recognize the feeling when you wake up and feel empty?
Just a void inside you and the urge to do something but not being decided
what it should be? The feeling of starting from scratch over and over again?
The feeling of knowing that no matter what you do it's going to be insignificant in this world?
It sucks, right?

Here's a simple trick which might work. Take a paper and a pencil and start writing down
all the things you think you should do and things you wanna do.
It can be anything from cleaning your teeth, making your bed, putting your pants up
or just simply closing door from your bedroom. Anything that gives you feeling you have
done something today. Pick any of the things you wrote down and just do it.
Once done just enjoy the feeling of making it done.
Allow yourself to admit you did something today.
You made something on your own. You finished one task in your day.
Then pick another one. Complete it. And another one. Gain momentum.
Every task that you do will get you closer to feeling less heavy.
Feel free to make a list of all the tasks you completed today to see.
To look back. To have a proof you really did something great today.
And yes, you are allowed to feel great about it.

Feeling less heavy will allow you to feel more relaxed.
What do you know, maybe you'll come up with an idea that will help people around
you. Something significant in this world. Maybe those people will help you back
in a way you can't imagine right now.
